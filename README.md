# SET_CookstoveData
This project analyses data from sensors installed in twenty households in Rwanda. The project was completed by Coventry University in colloboration with Rwanda Energy Group (REG) and MeshPower Ltd. Further details about the project can be found here: https://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/research-directories/current-projects/2022/set/

This repository provides the different code files used to analyse data from the sensors. Four type of sensors were installed:
- EXACT infrared sensor installed on the three-stone fire stoves to measure temperature
- EXACTv2 thermocouple sensor installed on the mudstoves, charcoal and improved biomass stoves to measure temperature
- FUEL sensors installed on the firewood and charcoal fuel baskets to measure fuel consumption
- HAPEx sensors installed in the kitchen to measure prticulate matter concentration

Data from the stoves was preprocessed...
